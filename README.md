# Description

This "Would You Rather" app uses a simple API which allows a user to view and interact with a list of polls asking "Would you rather...?" questions. Users can create new polls, vote for existing polls, and see the results of polls which they have answered already. There is also a "Leaderboard" which shows which users have been the most actively involved with creating polls and voting for polls.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is built using React and Redux, using node-sass for modularized css.

Styles and test coverage will also be improved.
